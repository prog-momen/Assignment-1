                Hi, you may be wondering whose project this is since I haven't introduced myself yet.
                Ok, my name is Momen, and programming has been my passion since childhood. While other kids were playing with dolls and cars,
                I was deconstructing them to find out how they worked. I've always had a real passion for electronics and everything about it.

            <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
            <p>Following others? Or self-driven passion?</p>

            <i>
                I chose programming because it's not limited to one field, but is used in almost every field: medicine, engineering, physics, chemistry, industry, commerce, etc.

            <p>Most of my hobbies happen behind the screen of my PC. I can quickly learn nearly anything, and I pick up new programming languages just as fast.</p>
            <p>One Of My Special Hobbies Is that I like To Try New Things—I have No Fear Of Trying Anything New,<br> especially Video-Games!
            One Of My Favorites Is <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Fortnite_Wiki">Fortnite</a> Its An online multiplayer game developed by <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/">Epic Games.</a>
        <br>And Last But Not Least I Like To Read Books That Is Useful To Me Not Just To entertain But To Earn A useful And Maybe New Skills .</p>

            Why Did I Say (Actual)? Well, we are somehow engineers—whether it's Front-End, Back-End, or Software Engineers.<br>
            But my favorite title is "Programmer." It's just a special and unique nickname to have.
